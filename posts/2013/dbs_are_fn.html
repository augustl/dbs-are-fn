<p>DB's are fn. Pun intended!</p>

<p><code>fn</code> denotes a function in Clojure.</p>

<pre><code data-lang="clojure">(fn [a b] (+ a  b))</code></pre>

<p>Most Clojure programmers refers to <code>fn</code>'s using the english word <strong>fun</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>Fun</strong> is the enjoyment of pleasure, particularly in leisure activities. Fun is an experience - short-term, often unexpected, informal, not cerebral and generally purposeless. It is an enjoyable distraction, diverting the mind and body from any serious task or contributing an extra dimension to it.

<p>This blog is more about <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">simplicity</a> than fun, though. In fact, you'll might get some blisters from reading this blog. But blisters never hurt anyone.</p>

<p>Datomic is the only contestant I'm aware of in the functional database space, and it's the database I'll be writing about. If a challenger apperas, I will certainly write about it, too.</p>

<p>Have <code>fn</code>!</p>
